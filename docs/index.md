# Polyphony

This documentation currently hosts information about polyproto; an advanced, secure and scalable

The core of the protocol lies in the [polyproto-core specification](./Protocol%20Specifications/core.md) and in the
federation API routes, which are used to negotiate and establish connections between foreign servers
