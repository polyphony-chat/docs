                            NOTE: By default, `filename` cannot be sent in request payloads and can only be sent in responses and multipart
                            payloads, as the `Content-Disposition` header is not valid in requests. If you want to send the `filename` in a request,
                            you must extend the `File` model and override the `filename` property with a different location defined by HTTP metadata
                            decorators.

    Models.P2Export:

        The data is a gzipped tarball (.tar.gz) named `export1234567890-user@subdomain.example.com`, where
        - `export[numbers]` is the word `export` with 20 random digits appended to it
        - `user` is the actors' name
        - `subdomain.example.com` is the FQDN of the server the actor is registered on.
        This file archive contains a file `messages.p2mb` which is a JSON file containing [message batches](https://docs.polyphony.chat/Protocol%20Specifications/core/#721-message-batches)
        of all messages sent by the user. If the server where the data export was requested from has
        [RawR](https://docs.polyphony.chat/Protocol%20Specifications/core/#731-resource-addressing-with-relative-roots) enabled, the file archive will contain a
        folder named `rawr`. This folder contains all RawR content uploaded by the actor to that server.
        The files in this folder are named after the resource ID given to the resource. File extensions are only
        added if they were known to the server. An example file name might be
        `2c851bfb6daffa944fa1723c7bd4d362ffbc9defe292f2daaf05e895989d179b.jxl`, referencing the file
        which was hosted at `<server_url>/.p2/core/resource/2c851bfb6daffa944fa1723c7bd4d362ffbc9defe292f2daaf05e895989d179b.jxl`.
        In addition, the folder `rawr` contains a file named `access_properties.p2al`. This JSON
        file contains a data structure mapping each resource ID to an access properties object.
        In particular, the file is structured as an array containing objects. Each object has a key which is equal
        to the resource ID of a resource in the `rawr` directory and a value which is an object
        representing the access properties. An example of the contents of this file is given below:

        ```json
        [
            {
                "2062a23e2a25b226ca4c546fec5ec06e0df9648281f45da8b5aaabebdf66cf4c.jxl": {
                "private": false,
                "public": false,
                "allowlist": ["user1@example.com", "instance.example.com"],
                "denylist": ["user2@example.com", "otherinstance@example.com"]
                }
            },
            {
                "a9144379a161e1fcf6b07801b70db6d6c481933bd634fe2409eb713723ab1a0a": {
                "private": true,
                "public": false,
                "allowlist": ["user1@example.com"],
                "denylist": []
                }
            }
        ]
        ```

        If the server where the data export was requested from is the actors' home server, the
        archive will contain a folder `certs` and a file `crypt_certs.p2epk`. `certs` will contain all ID-Certs
        the server has stored of the actor. The ID-Certs will be stored in
        [ASCII PEM format](https://web.archive.org/web/20250107131731/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/reference-x509-certificates#:~:text=ASN.1%20encoding.-,ascii%20pem%20format,-A%20PEM%20certificate).
        The file `crypt_certs.p2epk` contains all [encrypted private key material](https://docs.polyphony.chat/Protocol%20Specifications/core/#63-private-key-loss-prevention-and-private-key-recovery)
        that the actor has uploaded to the server. Just like `messages.p2mb`, `crypt_certs.p2epk` is a standard
        JSON file.
